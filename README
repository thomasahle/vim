The xkb file goes in /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/
(Maybe an entry also has to be added to /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/evdev.xml?)

Reapply the Layout: Use `setxkbmap` to apply your layout again with `setxkbmap thomas`.

Clear Cache: Ubuntu caches the keyboard layout data. If your changes aren't being recognized, it may help to clear this cache using the following commands:
```bash
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/xkb/*
sudo dpkg-reconfigure xkb-data
```

To check the current layout, you can use the following command:
```bash
setxkbmap -print -verbose 10
```

You can also use `onboard` to show the current layout on the screen.
